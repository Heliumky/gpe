#    pyGPE - A simple set of Python script to solve the Gross-Pitaevskii
#    equation for BEC's in 1D and 2D using a modified version of
#    Visscher's method.

#    Original paper for Visscher's method:
#    A fast explicit algorithm for the time-dependent Schroedinger equation

The code was developed using Python 3. It will run using Python 2, but
the performance of matplotlib's animation function is very slow.

applied to GPE.
